# Waterlily
A project bringing ethics back to Generative AI-Art


## Overview

Generative AI has been transformative in allowing users to create images in a variety of styles. However, the current standard of generative AI tools often uses pre-existing images without proper attribution, consent, or revenue given to the original creator. This can be problematic for artists who want to protect their work and ensure that it is being used in a responsible way.

Waterlily.ai solves this by building a new paradigm that will compensate original creators of artwork with micropayments whenever a user selects their style to create a new Stable Diffusion artwork from a prompt.

## Goals

- Leverage the benefits of FVM for payments and on-chain transparency
- Leverage the benefits of Bacalhau for decentralised ML models and verifiable off-chain computation
- Provide an ethical alternative for AI-generated Art that compensates original creators
